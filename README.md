## Problem: Time Between Customer Arrivals
Suppose you manage a small coffee shop, and you want to model the time between customer arrivals. Based on your observations, customers arrive at an average rate of 3 per hour. You want to find the probability that the next customer arrives within 10 minutes.

## Time Between Customer Arrivals: Exponential Distribution Analysis

This project models the time between customer arrivals at a coffee shop using the exponential distribution. The analysis was performed using Python in Google Colab, and we created graphs to visualize the results.

## Overview

In this project, we aim to:
- Model the time between customer arrivals using the exponential distribution.
- Calculate the probability that the next customer arrives within a specified time.
- Visualize the exponential distribution and the cumulative distribution function (CDF).
